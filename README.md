# Hadeez Restaurant POS

Desktop POS for Hadeez Restaurant — Orders, Menu, Stock, Staff, Credit, Reports. Built with Electron + React + Vite.

## Run

- **Development:** `npm run electron:dev`
- **Build:** `npm run dist`

## Troubleshooting

**Inputs stop responding (can’t type in fields):** If the app seems to hang and you can’t type in any input until you minimize and reopen the window, try minimizing the app window and then restoring it. This can happen occasionally due to focus/Electron behavior. If it persists, restart the application.
